/**
 * Bundle registers into read requests.
 *
 * Registers that sit exactly next to each other (no gap, no overlap) form a run; a run is cut into requests of at most
 * `maxWords`, and a new request starts where the registers no longer share a function code. This also bundles neighbours that
 * belong to other polling groups - reading them costs no extra request, and their states simply get a fresher value. A
 * request is only sent when it contains at least one `wanted` register. Registers with address overlaps (1392, 1441, 1483 and
 * their neighbours) are always read on their own so a neighbour never gets decoded out of a shared block. Gaps of unknown
 * addresses are never bridged: they answer with exception 02 and would fail the whole request.
 *
 * @param registers all candidate registers (any order); write-only registers are skipped
 * @param maxWords request size limit
 * @param wanted ids of the registers that are due; `undefined` = all of them
 * @param useDeviceFc false = use only the documented function code per register (single-register fallback)
